# 🌟 UserManagement

Welcome to the **UserManagement** project – my very first application developed during the **Gofive Internship** using **Angular 19** and **ASP.NET 9**.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before running the application, please follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to update the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

2. Execute the SQL script `scripts.sql` to populate the `Permissions` and `Role` tables.

   👉 [scripts.sql](./scripts.sql)

⚠️ This setup is required to enable full functionality of the app (such as adding users).
